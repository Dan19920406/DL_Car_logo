# How to use? 
## Follow the step as below

1. Use jupyter-notebook open with DL_carLogo2.ipynb

2. Load dataset and labeling data

3. Training model

4. Test model accurancy with test data or some never seen's picture

# Second version Deep learning practice with "Data Augmentation"
File : DL_carLogo_DataGenerator_version.ipynb

## Changed

1. Folder structure changed for ImageDataGenerator().flow_from_directory(class_mode='categorical')

2. Use generator create more data for training model (Data Augmentation)
